==================

This project relates to our 4th weekend challenge. This week we were focusing on databases, learning how to use a Postgres database in our Sinatra applications. Completed solo on 9th-10th June 2018. I have created the following user stories:

```
As a user
So that I can can review a movie I've seen
I want to add a film to Faldo-movie-ratings (FMR)

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I think of a film
I want to post a comment to a film

As a user
So that I can see what films have been reviewed
I want to see all films in alphabetical order

As a user
So that I can see how old a review is
I want to see the date it was made

As a user
So that I can post reviews on FMR as me
I want to sign up for FMR’s
```
