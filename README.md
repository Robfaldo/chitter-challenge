==================

This project relates to our 4th weekend challenge. This week we were focusing on databases, learning how to use a Postgres database in our Sinatra applications. Completed solo on 9th-10th June 2018. I have created the following user stories:

```
As a user
So that I can let people know what I think of a film  
I want to post a film score to faldo-movie-ratings.

As a user
So that I can see what films have been reviewed
I want to see all films in alphabetical order

As a user
So that I can better appreciate the context of a review
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a user
So that I can post reviews on FMR as me
I want to sign up for FMRâ€™s
```

## Motivation
